# AirgeadBankingApp

Sarah Short, October 27, 2024

The Airgead Banking app allows a user to input an initial investment amount, montly deposits, annual interest rate, and number of years for the investment. Then the app calculates and outputs two reports. The first shows the year-end balance and interest without additional monthly deposits and the other shows with additional montly deposits. It shows the user how different variables affect savings and investments.

When working on this app, I feel I did well using object-oriented programming by encapsulating the investment calculations inside of the InvestmentCalculator class. This will make the application easier to maintain or update if I need to.

One place where I could enhance the code would be to provide further input validation, to ensure the app can handle any kind of input or mistakes a user may make, and give appropriate feedback to the user on how to fix it.

The most challenging part of the code was ensuring the interest calcuations were correct.

The skill that will be most helpful to me moving forward is developing my skills at object-oriented programming. This skill is essential when writing efficient and complicated code in C++.

One way that I made sure that my program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable was including in-line comments describing my code. Also, I used good coding practices when naming variables and functions, like using camelCase. This improves code readablilty.
